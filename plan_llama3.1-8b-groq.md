Here are a few key highlights and analysis points from the financial statements of Cartolito, S.A. de C.V.:

Balance Sheet:

- The company has seen steady growth in total assets, increasing from MXN 63,560 in 2020 to MXN 155,150 as of June 2023. This has been driven by increases in both current assets like inventory and receivables as well as significant investments in fixed assets (land, buildings, machinery & equipment).

- Liabilities have also risen but at a slower pace than assets. Total debt stood at MXN 81,387 as of June 2023 compared to MXN 34,220 in 2020. The debt-to-equity ratio has decreased from 1.17 in 2020 to 1.10 in June 2023, showing an improvement in the capital structure.

- Net worth has more than doubled from MXN 29,340 in 2020 to MXN 73,762 as of June 2023, supported by retained earnings growth and revaluation reserves.

Income Statement:

- Revenues have shown healthy growth, rising from MXN 50,659 in 2020 to MXN 77,648 for the full year 2022, a 53% increase.  

- Gross and operating profit margins have remained relatively stable over the period, in the 18-20% and 12-13% range respectively. This shows the company has been able to maintain profitability despite cost pressures.

- Interest expense has increased significantly as debt levels have risen. However, interest coverage remains adequate at 1.29x as of June 2023.

Cash Flows:

- Operating cash flows turned negative in 2021 and for the first 6 months of 2023, mainly due to large working capital investments in inventory and receivables. 

- Investing outflows have been substantial in 2021-2023, driven by the significant CAPEX investments in property, plant and equipment. This has been funded by additional debt as well as internal accruals.

- Financing cash flows have been strongly positive due to the debt raise. The company has not paid any dividends.

Key Ratios:

- Liquidity ratios like the current ratio have deteriorated somewhat but still remain at satisfactory levels (1.36 as of June 2023)

- Asset turnover has decreased as the asset base has grown faster than revenues. Return on equity has declined from 5.65% in 2020 to 2.28% (annualized) as of June 2023.

- Receivable and inventory turnover ratios have weakened, indicating a slower conversion of working capital to cash. 

In summary, the company has made significant investments for growth which have pressured cash flows and returns in the near-term. However, it has maintained profitability and a manageable leverage position. The key will be to generate higher revenues and cash flows from the expanded asset base over time to improve the return ratios back towards historical levels.
