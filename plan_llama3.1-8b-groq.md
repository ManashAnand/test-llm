Based on the financial statements provided for Cartolito, S.A. de C.V., here are a few key observations:

Balance Sheet:
- The company has seen significant growth in total assets over the period, increasing from MXN 63.6 million at the end of 2020 to MXN 155.2 million as of June 30, 2023. This has been driven largely by increases in fixed assets, particularly through revaluations.

- Liabilities have also grown substantially, from MXN 34.2 million in 2020 to MXN 81.4 million as of June 2023. Most of this growth has come from increased bank borrowings, both short-term and long-term.

- Net worth has more than doubled over the period due to the asset revaluations and retained earnings growth.

Income Statement: 
- Sales have grown at a robust rate, increasing over 50% from 2020 to 2022. Gross margins have remained relatively stable around 19-20%.

- Operating expenses as a percentage of sales have trended downward slightly, allowing operating profit margins to expand modestly to over 12%.

- Net profit margins have compressed some due to higher interest expenses. Net income growth has lagged sales growth as a result.

Cash Flow:
- Operating cash flow turned negative in the trailing 12 months ending June 2023 after being positive in 2021 and 2022. This appears driven by large working capital investments.

- Investing activities have consumed significant cash, primarily for CAPEX spending which has exceeded operating cash flow.

- The company has relied on bank financing to fund the gap and support its growth investments. Annual bank debt increased by over MXN 11 billion in both 2021 and 2022.

Ratios:
- Liquidity ratios like the current ratio have declined as current liabilities have grown faster than current assets. The company still appears sufficiently liquid though.

- Leverage has increased with the debt-to-equity ratio now over 1.0x. Coverage ratios have weakened but are still adequate.

- Profitability ratios like ROE and ROA have compressed as asset and equity growth has outpaced earnings growth. Margins remain healthy though.

- Activity ratios show some negative trends, with receivable and inventory days increasing. This is pressuring cash flows.

In summary, Cartolito has rapidly grown its asset base and sales in recent years, funded by a combination of debt and equity (through revaluations). Profit margins are decent but have lagged asset growth. Operating cash flows have weakened and the company has become more reliant on external bank financing. While still growing nicely, Cartolito may want to focus on cash flow and profitability to avoid becoming overextended.
