Based on the detailed financial statements provided for Cartolito, S.A. de C.V., here are a few key takeaways and insights:

Balance Sheet:
- The company's total assets have grown steadily from MXN 63.6M in 2020 to MXN 155.2M as of June 2023. The growth has come from both current assets like inventory and receivables as well as significant additions to fixed assets like land, buildings and machinery.

- Liabilities have also increased, but at a slower pace than total assets. This has allowed net worth to improve from MXN 29.3M in 2020 to MXN 73.8M in June 2023. The company has financed asset growth through a mix of debt and retained profits.

Income Statement: 
- Sales have grown at a healthy rate, from MXN 50.7M in 2020 to an annual run-rate of over MXN 80M based on the June 2023 results. Gross margins have remained relatively stable around 19-20%.

- Net profit margins have declined slightly from 3.3% in 2020 to 2.0% in the latest period, likely due to higher interest expense as debt levels increased. However, EBITDA margins remain strong at nearly 15%.

Cash Flow Statement:
- Cash flows from operations turned negative in the last 12 months due to large working capital investments in receivables and inventory. 

- The company has made substantial investments in fixed assets over the past few years which have been funded by increases in long-term debt.

Key Ratios:
- Liquidity ratios like the current ratio have deteriorated somewhat as current liabilities grew faster than current assets. However, the ratios are still adequate at 1.36x.

- Leverage has increased with the debt-to-equity ratio rising from 1.17x to 1.25x before improving to 1.10x recently. Debt levels remain manageable with interest coverage over 1.2x.

- Activity ratios show receivables and inventory turnover slowing down, putting pressure on working capital. Asset turnover has declined from 0.80x to 0.55x.

- Profitability ratios are still decent with ROE of 2.3% and operating margins over 12%. However, they have weakened compared to 2020 levels.

In summary, Cartolito has achieved impressive growth in recent years by investing heavily in working capital and production capacity. While this has pressured cash flows and increased leverage, profitability remains solid. The company should focus on optimizing working capital and capacity utilization to strengthen cash flows and margins going forward. Overall, the financial position looks satisfactory assuming growth investments pay off.
